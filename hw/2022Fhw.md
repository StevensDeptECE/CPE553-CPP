## Week 1
1. Read notes sections on integer types (int, long, short, char)
1. Read notes sections on floating point types (float, double, long double)
1. Read notes sections on standardized types (uint8_t, uint16_t, uint32_t, uint64_t,...)
1. Read notes on statements  if(), while(), for(), do..while()
1. Review what we discussed about overflow
1. Predict what you should see for the following code, compile and be ready to discuss
```cpp
uint8_t a = 254;
a = a + 1;
cout << a << '\n';
a = a + 1;
cout << a << '\n';
uint16_t b = 65534;
cout << (b + 1) << (b + 2) << '\n';
b = b + 1;
cout << b << '\n';
b = b + 1;
cout << b << '\n';
```

  1.1 uint8_t
  1.1 uint16_t
  1.1 uint32_t
  1.1 uint64_t
  1.1 int8_t
  1.1 int16_t
  1.1 int32_t
  1.1 int64_t
1. Implement the problems assigned in Canvas

1. Find the bug 14summation2.cc

## Week 2

1. Read notes sections on floating point library functions
1. Read notes sections on inf and nan
1. Predict what you should see for the following code:
```cpp
```
1. Implement the problems assigned in Canvas

## Week 3

1. Read notes sections on object-oriented programming
1. Do homeworks specified in [2022F_hw3.cc](2022F_hw3.cc)
1. Predict what  you should see for the following code:
```cpp
int a = 32768 * 65536 + 1;
cout << a << '\n';
double b = 0;
for (int i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
  b += 0.1;
cout << (b != 1) << '\n';
for (float x = 0; x < 1; x += 0.1) // what is wrong with this loop?
  cout << x << ' ';
int x;
for (x = 0; x < 10; x++)
  cout << x;
cout << '\n' << x << '\n';
x = 10;
do {
  cout << "Y";
  x++;
} while (x < 10);
```

## Week 4: Object-Oriented Programming
