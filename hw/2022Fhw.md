1. [Set up git](https://DovKrugerCourses/setupgit.md)
1. Clone the repository for the course materials and homework
  - ```bash git clone github.com/stevensdeptece/CPE553-CPP```



## Week 1
1. Read notes sections on integer types (int, long, short, char)
1. Read notes sections on floating point types (float, double, long double)
1. Read notes sections on standardized types (uint8_t, uint16_t, uint32_t, uint64_t,...)
1. Read notes on statements  if(), while(), for(), do..while()
1. Review what we discussed about overflow
1. Predict what you should see for the following code, compile and be ready to discuss
```cpp
uint8_t a = 254;
a = a + 1;
cout << a << '\n';
a = a + 1;
cout << a << '\n';
uint16_t b = 65534;
cout << (b + 1) << (b + 2) << '\n';
b = b + 1;
cout << b << '\n';
b = b + 1;
cout << b << '\n';
